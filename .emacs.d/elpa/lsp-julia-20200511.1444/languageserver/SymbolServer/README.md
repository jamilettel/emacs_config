SymbolServer is a helper package for LanguageServer.jl that provides information about internal and exported variables of packages (without loading them). A package's symbol information is initially loaded in an external process but then stored on disc for (quick loading) future use.

Documentation for working with Julia environments is available [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl).


## API

```julia
SymbolServerProcess(path_to_env)
```
Launches a server process (with given enviroment) and retrieves the active context. This client side process (this) contains a depot of retrieved packages.

```julia
change_env(ssp::SymbolServerProcess, env_path::String)
```
Activates a new environment on the server. The new active context must then be retrieved separately.

```julia
get_context(ssp::SymbolServerProcess)
```
Retrieves the active context (environment) from the server.


```julia
load_manifest_packages(ssp)
load_project_packages(ssp)
```
Load all packages from the current active environments manifest or project into the client
side depot.
